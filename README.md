# Developing

You are expected to install the dependencies with `npm install` before anything else.

You should copy any source dependencies into `source/` for easier development, run `npm run link` to do this.

## Testing

The test suite can run in either CLI or the browser, except for the tests that depend on a browser environment, localStorage for example, these will be skipped in the CLI environment.

Run `npm test` for the CLI, or open `test/browser.html` in your browser.

## Building

Install the dependencies with `npm install`, followed by `npm run build` to clean and release everything into `dist/` for you.
